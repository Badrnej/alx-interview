# Concepts Needed

## HTTP Requests in JavaScript

- **Understanding HTTP Requests:** Learn how to make HTTP requests to external services using the `request` module or alternatives like `fetch` in Node.js.
  - **Resource:** [A Complete Guide to Making HTTP Requests in Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/making-http-requests-with-nodejs)

## Working with APIs

- **RESTful APIs:** Understand the basics of RESTful APIs and how to interact with them.
- **Parsing JSON Data:** Learn how to parse JSON data returned by APIs.
  - **Resource:** [Working with APIs in JavaScript](https://javascript.info/fetch)

## Asynchronous Programming

- **Managing Asynchronous Operations:** Learn to manage asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and `async/await` syntax.
- **Handling API Response Data:** Work with API responses asynchronously.
  - **Resource:** [Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous)

## Command Line Arguments in Node.js

- **Accessing Command-Line Arguments:** Use the `process.argv` array to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.
  - **Resource:** [How to Parse Command Line Arguments in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/command-line/how-to-parse-command-line-arguments/)

## Array Manipulation and Iteration

- **Iterating Over Arrays:** Learn to iterate over arrays and manipulate data structures to format and display character names.
  - **Resource:** [JavaScript Array Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

By familiarizing yourself with these concepts and resources, you will be able to efficiently retrieve, process, and display Star Wars characters from the specified movie using the Star Wars API. This will demonstrate your ability to work with external APIs and manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.

## Additional Resources

- **Mock Technical Interview:** Practice your skills and get ready for technical interviews.
